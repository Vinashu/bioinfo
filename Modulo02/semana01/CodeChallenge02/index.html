        String Spelled by a Genome Path Problem. Reconstruct a string from its genome path.
            Input: A sequence of k-mers Pattern1, … ,Patternn such that the last k - 1 symbols of Patterni are equal to the first k-1 symbols of Patterni+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-1.
            Output: A string Text of length k+n-1 such that the i-th k-mer in Text is equal to Patterni  (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

        Sample Input:
            ACCGA
            CCGAA
            CGAAG
            GAAGC
            AAGCT
        Sample Output:
            ACCGAAGCT
