Welcome to class!

This course will focus on two questions at the forefront of modern computational biology, along with the algorithmic approaches we will use to solve them in parentheses:

Weeks 1-2: How Do We Assemble Genomes? (Graph Algorithms)
How Do We Sequence Antibiotics? (Brute Force Algorithms)
Each of the two chapters of content in the class is accompanied by a Bioinformatics Cartoon created by talented San Diego artist Randall Christopher. You can find the first chapter's cartoon at the bottom of this message. What does a time machine trip to 1735, a stack of newspapers, a jigsaw puzzle, and a giant ant invading a riverside city have to do with putting together a genome? Start learning today to find out!
