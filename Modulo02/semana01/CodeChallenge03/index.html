        Code Challenge: Solve the Overlap Graph Problem (restated below).
            Input: A collection Patterns of k-mers.
            Output: The overlap graph Overlap(Patterns), in the form of an adjacency list. (You may return the edges in any order.)  

        Sample Input:
            ATGCG
            GCATG
            CATGC
            AGGCA
            GGCAT

        Sample Output:
            CATGC -> ATGCG
            GCATG -> CATGC
            GGCAT -> GCATG
            AGGCA -> GGCAT
