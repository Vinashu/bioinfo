This course will focus on two questions at the forefront of modern computational biology, along with the algorithmic approaches we will use to solve them in parentheses:

Weeks 1-2: Where in the Genome Does DNA Replication Begin? (Algorithmic Warmup)<br>
Weeks 3-4: Which DNA Patterns Play the Role of Molecular Clocks? (Randomized Algorithms)<br>
Week 5 will consist of a Bioinformatics Application Challenge in which you will get to apply software for finding DNA motifs to a real biological dataset.

Each of the two chapters in the course is accompanied by a Bioinformatics Cartoon created by Randall Christopher. You can find the first chapter's cartoon at the bottom of this message. What does a cryptic message leading to buried treasure have to do with biology? We hope you will join us to find out!
